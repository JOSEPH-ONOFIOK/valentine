## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for the playful animations (running button, heart pulse, page transitions)
canvas-confetti | for the celebration effect when she says yes
@types/canvas-confetti | types for confetti

## Notes
The backend has a POST /api/valentine/respond endpoint.
The frontend needs to handle the "No" button running away interaction purely in client state before any API call.
Fonts: 'Pacifico' for headers (handwriting style) and 'Quicksand' for body text (soft, rounded).
